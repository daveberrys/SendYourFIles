# Why did we make this?
We didn't like Discord's 10 mb restriction. We usually have big files, like zips, videos and such.
So, Daveberry and Runyra made this program for you all to not suffer with the 10mb hell!

We hope you, as the user, enjoy our software and give us a star if you love and keep on using this software.
It gives us more motivation to keep continuing this project and making this app better.

# Running the app
## WINDOWS
In **Windows**, you just need [WebView2 over here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2?form=MA13LH#download) and then you can run it.

## LINUX
In **Linux**, it's a bit of a tricky set up.

If you tried to open the app with the required dependencies, it'll say something like `webview.errors.WebViewException: You must have either QT or GTK with Python extensions installed in order to use pywebview.` which won't ever open the app unless you have GTK webview.

You'll need `webkitgtk6.0` (or maybe a lower version?), which you have to find in your operating system's package manager.

## MACOS
Just open the app and you're done. No need to download anything else other than the app.

# Compiling the app
## WINDOWS
It's simple, really.
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/PinpointTools/SendYourFiles/
cd SendYourFiles
python3 -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\pip install -r requirements.txt
venv\Scripts\pyinstaller build.spec
```

## LINUX
Linux is... Compilcated. As of right now, I only compiled for Ubuntu using Distrobox.

First of all, you're gonna have to install developer dependencies. Make sure you already have `python3`, `python3-pip` and `python3-venv` installed before this!
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
  build-essential \
  pkg-config \
  python3-dev \
  libcairo2-dev \
  libgirepository1.0-dev \
  libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev \
  libgtk-3-dev \
  gir1.2-gtk-3.0 \
  gir1.2-webkit2-4.1 \
  libayatana-appindicator3-dev \
  gir1.2-ayatanaappindicator3-0.1 \
  dbus \
  libdbus-1-dev \
  gir1.2-dbusmenu-gtk3-0.4 \
  gir1.2-dbus-1.0
```
Once that's done, just do this commands and you're done.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PinpointTools/SendYourFiles/
cd SendYourFiles
python3 -m venv venv
venv/Scripts/pip install -r requirements.txt
venv/Scripts/pyinstaller build.spec
```

## MACOS
Like windows, this is also insanely simple.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PinpointTools/SendYourFiles/
cd SendYourFiles
python3 -m venv venv
venv/Scripts/pip install -r requirements.txt
venv/Scripts/pyinstaller build.spec
```
